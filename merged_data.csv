717158001,"A severe deficiency of spermatogenesis. Chromosome Y deletions are a frequent genetic cause of male infertility. The mode of transmission follows a Y-linked pattern, with incomplete penetrance, but as deletions are often associated with infertility, they generally occur de novo. Molecular diagnosis is made by PCR amplification of STS type sequences (sequence-tagged sites) from the AZFa, b, and c regions. All chromosome Y deletions do not necessarily lead to infertility: firstly, some deletions (especially some partial deletions) do not result in spermatogenesis defects; secondly, among men with severe oligospermia, some can father children without infertility treatment. Finally, when mature spermatozoa are found in the sperm or in the testicles, the infertility problem can be solved with medically assisted procreation techniques. However, there is a risk of transmitting the microdeletion to every male infant."

Hypopigmentation can be observed. This anomaly of the hair shaft occurs in normal hair, pili canaliculi, or monilethrix and has been associated with the mosaic trisomy 8 syndrome, pseudomonilethrix type II or protein deficiency states. It can also be secondary to ulcerative colitis and extensive bowel resection. Caused by a transient duplication of the papilla's tip during the anagen phase, leading to the transitory production a two complete shafts, in the same follicular matrix, that emerge through a single pilary canal. When the two papilla tips fuse, both parallel branches form a single shaft again. When the transient duplication of the papilla tip occurs repetitively during the anagen phase, a series of bifurcation-fusion can be observed along the shaft. This situation is called pili multi-bifurcati. As a duplicated papilla tip can split again, a doubly bifurcated shaft may be observed: pili bi-bifurcati."

718228001,"Fetal iodine syndrome is a group of symptoms that may be observed in a fetus or newborn when the mother was exposed during pregnancy to inappropriate (excessive or insufficient) amounts of iodine, a nonmetallic halogen element. Maternal iodine can be readily transferred to the fetus, and chronic maternal exposure to iodine can lead to hypothyroidism and goiter in the offspring. The majority of the reported fatalities caused by iodine intoxication resulted from the use of iodine-containing expectorants during pregnancy. Based on these observations, the repeated or routine use of iodine-containing products is not recommended during pregnancy. In addition to the problems associated with iodine intoxication, iodine deficiency during pregnancy may be severe enough to produce hypothyroidism in the fetus."

Various anomalies of the breasts and nipples, and variable involvement of the hand and forearm (some patients having normal hands) have also been reported. The absence of other muscles around the shoulder girdle is a frequent feature. The syndrome is thought to be of vascular origin, for example a result of a disruption in the blood supply in the subclavian artery. Poland syndrome is most commonly a sporadic condition, but rare familial cases have been reported, compatible with an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance."

It has been described in 8 patients to date. Common dysmorphic features include micrognathia, microcephaly, preauricular pits, high-arched palate and abnormal ears. All patients except one have intellectual deficit. The syndrome is caused by deletions of the proximal part of the short arm of chromosome 8 (8p11.1 to 8p21). The deletions can be cytogenetically detected and their size is variable. The loss of the ankyrin-1 gene (ANK1) results in congenital spherocytosis."
719684000,"Syndrome associated with unusual and characteristic multi-organ clinical features, which include hearing loss, congenital heart defects, intellectual disability, hypotonia in infancy and Duane anomaly. It has been described in two patients. The lack of recurrent breakpoints in these two cases and the absence of any low-copy repeats pairs that flank these de novo events do not support non-allelic homologous recombination as the mutation mechanism. The 8q12 region includes CHD7 and it is proposed that this gene, associated with CHARGE syndrome by haploinsufficiency, causes a different phenotype by gain-of-dosage."

The clinical manifestation is mycobacterial infections occurring in males. Diagnosis is made by laboratory analysis. Low levels of IFN-gamma and IL-12 production by the patients' mononuclear cells upon phytohemagglutinin (PHA) are detected in those with an IKBKG mutation. In addition, an impaired IL-12 production by monocytes upon PHA stimulation by activated T cells is shown. Impaired NADPH activity is demonstrated in vitro in macrophages and B-cell lines in those with a CYBB mutation. A mutational analysis is necessary to identify the exact causative genes involved allowing for the implementation of a specific treatment plan."

The hearing loss may be described as sensorineural or it may be caused by auditory neuropathy. The hearing loss is either present at birth or begins in infancy, before the child learns to speak. This syndrome is caused by mutations in the SLITRK6 gene. The protein produced from this gene is found primarily in the inner ear and the eye. SLITRK6 gene mutations result in an abnormally short SLITRK6 protein that is not anchored properly to the cell membrane meaning the protein is unable to function normally. Impaired SLITRK6 protein function leads to abnormal nerve development in the inner ear and improperly controlled eyeball growth."
720507006,"Syndrome with characteristics of sick sinus syndrome and intestinal pseudo-obstruction. The heart and digestive issues develop at the same time, usually by age 20. The syndrome is caused by mutations in the SGO1 gene. This gene provides instructions for making part of a protein complex cohesin. This protein complex helps control the placement of chromosomes during cell division. Research suggests that SGO1 gene mutations may result in a cohesin complex that is less able to hold sister chromatids together, resulting in decreased chromosomal stability during cell division. This instability is thought to cause senescence of cells in the intestinal muscle and in the sinoatrial node, resulting in problems maintaining proper rhythmic movements of the heart and intestines."

720940008,"A disorder that affects the ability to break down lipids leading to increased amounts of triglycerides and cholesterol in the blood. Caused by mutations in the lipase C hepatic type (LIPC) gene. This gene provides instructions for making hepatic lipase. LIPC gene mutations prevent the release of hepatic lipase from the liver or decrease the enzyme's activity in the bloodstream. As a result very low-density lipoproteins and intermediate-density lipoproteins are not efficiently converted into LDLs, and HDLs carrying cholesterol and triglyceride remain in the bloodstream. It is unclear what effect this change in lipid levels has on people with hepatic lipase deficiency."

721105004,"A syndrome affecting the development of blood vessels, soft tissue and bone with three characteristic features: port-wine stain, abnormal overgrowth of soft tissues and bones and venous malformations. Caused by mutations in the PIK3CA gene. This gene provides instructions for making the p110 alpha (p110α) protein, which is a subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). The PIK3CA gene mutations associated with Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome alter the p110α protein. The altered subunit makes PI3K abnormally active, which allows cells to grow and divide continuously.

722008003,"A form of familial primary hypomagnesemia characterized by low serum magnesium values but normal urinary magnesium values. The typical clinical features are recurrent muscle cramps, episodes of tetany, tremor, and muscle weakness, especially in distal limbs. The disease is potentially fatal. The disease has only been described in one large Brazilian kindred with 46 family members, of whom 21 were affected. Caused by a N255D mutation in the KCNA1 gene (12p13), which encodes the voltage-gated potassium channel Kv1.1. Mutations in KCNA1 result in a nonfunctional channel protein, with a dominant negative effect on wild-type Kv1.1 channel function, which is involved in the maintenance of membrane voltage and optimal function of the TRPM6 channel. Transmission is autosomal dominant."

The phenotypic spectrum of this disease is still being determined. Caused by mutations in the protein kinase, interferon-inducible double stranded RNA dependent activator (PRKRA) gene, located on chromosome 2q31.2. Inherited in an autosomal recessive manner."
722436002,"A rare subtype of dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa that shows no blistering and that has characteristics of dystrophic or absent nails. Prevalence is unknown. Approximately ten families have been reported to date. However, this variant may be overlooked because of negligible clinical implications. Onset is usually at birth or during infancy. Except from nail involvement, no other cutaneous or extracutaneous symptoms are observed. Nail deformity is often limited to toenails that can appear thickened and shortened. Caused by mutations within the type VII collagen gene (COL7A1). It usually follows an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. One family with an autosomal recessive inheritance has also been reported."

Only five cases have been reported so far, two of who were siblings. In the three nonfamilial cases, unilateral pulmonary agenesis and microphthalmia were associated with diaphragmatic hernia and pulmonary vessel agenesis. It has been suggested that two different entities can be distinguished: on one hand, the association of anophthalmia-pulmonary hypoplasia with/without anomalies of the face, heart, spleen and uterus, which may be due to a putative autosomal recessive gene with pleiotropic effects; on the other hand, a sporadic association including pulmonary hypoplasia, anophthalmia, unilateral diaphragmatic defect and agenesis of the pulmonary trunk, which may represent the expression of a developmental field defect.

The seizures tend to be refractory to treatment. Most affected children have severe intellectual disability. Vision and hearing may be normal at birth but become impaired as the disease progresses. Some affected individuals have changes in skin pigmentation. Mutations in the ST3GAL5 gene have been found to cause GM3 synthase deficiency. This gene provides instructions for the enzyme GM3 synthase, which carries out a chemical reaction that is the first step in the production of gangliosides. ST3GAL5 gene mutations prevent the production of any functional GM3 synthase. Without this enzyme, cells cannot produce gangliosides normally."

It has been reported in 2 unrelated patients. Facial dysmorphism includes high forehead, broad nasal bridge, thin upper lip, small chin and malformed ears. In addition, the patients presented with skin, iris and hair hypopigmentation and abnormal adipose tissue distribution. The syndrome is caused by an interstitial deletion of paternal origin at 20q13.2q13.3. In the 2 cases, the deletion was approximately 4.5Mb in size and encompassed the GNAS imprinted locus; the loss of the paternally expressed GNAS gene might account for the severe pre and post-natal retardation and intractable feeding difficulties observed in the patients."

There is no impairment of the immune system and a wide spectrum of ophthalmologic abnormalities has been described. Molecular data has shed light on the complex relationship that exists between this syndrome and Griscelli syndrome. Mutations in the myosin Va gene (MYOVA) result in the so-called Griscelli syndrome type 1. MYOVA encodes myosin Va, an actin-based motor protein important for the intracellular transport of organelles in melanocyte and neuronal cells. It is very likely that Griscelli syndrome type 1 corresponds to with this syndrome."

724099000,"In adults over 50 years of age, Fanconi syndrome is frequently related to the urinary secretion of a monoclonal immunoglobulin (Ig) light chain (LC), almost always of the kappa isotype. Prevalence is unknown but around 100 cases have been described in the literature so far. Onset occurs during adulthood: bone pain related to osteomalacia secondary to hypophosphatemia and progressive chronic renal failure are the usual manifestations. These manifestations may precede the diagnosis of a slowly progressive plasma cell disorder by several years. In most cases, the monoclonal kappa light chain is restricted to the V kappa-1 subgroup and bears non-polar or hydrophobic mutations in the variable domain, which induce resistance to cathepsin proteolysis in the proximal tubular cells and promote crystallization of the variable domain within the endolysosomal compartment."

724351008,"A hereditary neurological disorder with characteristics of excessive startle responses. The disease manifests shortly after birth with violent jerking to noise and touch, and massive and sustained stiffening of the trunk and limbs, clenching fists, and attacks of a high frequency trembling. Motor milestones are often mildly delayed, but intellectual development is usually normal. Mutations in the GLRA1 gene (5q32) are found in about 30% of patients. These mutations are transmitted as an autosomal dominant or recessive trait. The GLRA1 gene encodes the alpha1 subunit of the juvenile neuronal receptor for the inhibitory neurotransmitter, glycine. Mutations of this subunit cause a variety of dysfunctions of the neuronal chloride (Cl-) channel. Mutations in the GLRB, GPHN and SLC6A5 genes (4q31.3, 14q24 and 11p15.2-p15.1) have also been observed."

Clinical features depend on the disease type. Most forms of HCHWA (Dutch, Arctic, Piedmont, Iowa, Flemish and Italian) are due to a point-mutation in the APP gene on chromosome 21q21.2, which encodes the beta-amyloid precursor protein. This mutation causes increased accumulation of amyloid-beta protein in the walls of cerebral arteries and capillaries. Only one form of HCHWA, Icelandic type, is due to a mutation in the CST3 gene on chromosome 20p11.2, encoding the precursor protein cystatin C."

Most forms of HCHWA (Dutch, Arctic, Piedmont, Iowa, Flemish and Italian) are due to a point-mutation in the APP gene on chromosome 21q21.2, which encodes the beta-amyloid precursor protein. This mutation causes increased accumulation of amyloid-beta protein in the walls of cerebral arteries and capillaries. Only one form of HCHWA, Icelandic type, is due to a mutation in the CST3 gene on chromosome 20p11.2, encoding the precursor protein cystatin C."

724383002,"A rare dystonia with a combination of hemidystonia involving one half of the body and hemiatrophy on the same side. Hemidystonia which is sustained and repetitive muscle contractions resulting in abnormal movements or posture involving a single side of the body is preceded in 90% of cases by hemiparesis with a marked improvement before the onset of hemidystonia. Pyramidal syndrome and seizures may also be observed. The syndrome is associated with ipsilateral somatic atrophy. Common causes are childbirth or perinatal complications, delayed sequelae of stroke or head trauma. This syndrome should be differentiated from other causes of primary dystonia or dystonia secondary to inherited disorders or neurodegenerative diseases."

The disorder is heterogeneous and associated with partial abnormality of both Leydig cell and Sertoli cell function that may result from deletions or point mutations in the SRY gene or dose sensitive sex (NR0B1) locus duplication on the X chromosome. More important are mutations in steroidogenic factor 1 (SF1, NR5A1, Ad4BP). SF-1 is a nuclear receptor and regulator of multiple genes involved in adrenal and gonadal development, steroidogenesis, and the reproductive axis. Therefore, affected patients may also have adrenal insufficiency. Syndromic forms have been associated with WT-1 mutations, which lead to variable testicular dysgenesis and an increased risk of renal abnormalities, namely Wilms tumors or nephrotic syndrome."

725164008,"Omodysplasia is a rare skeletal dysplasia characterized by severe limb shortening and facial dysmorphism. Two types of omodysplasia have been described: an autosomal recessive or generalized form (also referred to as micromelic dysplasia with dislocation of radius) marked by severe micromelic dwarfism with predominantly rhizomelic shortening of both the upper and lower limbs, and an autosomal dominant form in which stature is normal and shortening is limited to the upper limbs. In total, less than 40 cases of omodysplasia have been described in the literature so far, with the majority of reported cases concerning the autosomal recessive form of the disease. The etiology remains unknown but a paternally inherited paracentric inversion of 15q13 to q21.3 has been detected in one family."

725296006,"A lysosomal storage disease with clinical characteristics of psychomotor retardation and visual abnormalities including corneal clouding, retinal degeneration or strabismus. The disease is rare in the general population but is more prevalent among Ashkenazi Jews. First signs appear during the first year of life or later, but clinical progression is usually slow. In this disease phospholipids, gangliosides and mucopolysaccharides accumulate in lysosomal inclusions, some of which resemble membranous cytoplasmic bodies found in gangliosidoses. The condition seems to be caused by anomalies in the endocytosis of membrane components towards the lysosomes. The causative gene, MCOLN1, is located in the 19p13.3-p13.2 region and encodes mucolipin-1 (MLN1), a membrane protein from the transient receptor potential (TRP) channel family. The disease is transmitted as an autosomal recessive trait."

725407006,A subtype of dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa characterized by generalized cutaneous and mucosal blistering that is not associated with severe deformities.The disease manifests at birth or during the neonatal period with generalized blistering. Aplasia cutis congenita can also be observed at birth. The disease is caused by mutations within the type VII collagen gene (COL7A1) that lead to an alteration of function or a reduction in the amounts of collagen VII. This impairs collagen VII assembly into anchoring fibrils which anchor the basement membrane to the underlying dermis. This in turn causes reduced skin resistance to minor trauma. Transmission is autosomal recessive.

725431001,"A genetic variant of mendelian susceptibility to mycobacterial diseases (MSMD) with characteristics of a partial deficiency in IFN-gammaR1, leading to a residual response to IFN-gamma and, consequently, to recurrent, moderately severe infections with bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) and other environmental mycobacteria. These infections are recurrent but less severe than those seen in MSMD due to complete IFN-gammaR1 and IFN-gammaR2 deficiencies. Caused by homozygous mutations in the IFNGR1 gene on chromosome 6q23-q24 that encodes the IFN-gamma receptor ligand binding chain. The most common mutation is, by far, I87T. This mutation leads to the expression of IFN-gamma receptors on the cell surface with no signal transduction capacity and they therefore only show a partial response to IFN-gamma. Transmission is autosomal recessive."
725150008,A genetic variant of mendelian susceptibility to mycobacterial disease with characteristics of a partial deficiency leading to impaired IFN-gamma immunity and consequently recurrent moderately severe infections with bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) and other environmental mycobacteria. Caused by heterozygous mutations in the IFNGR1 gene on chromosome 6q23-q24 that encodes the IFN-gamma receptor ligand binding chain. Microdeletion 818del4 is by far the most common mutation and it corresponds to the first documented hotspot for a microdeletion in the human genome. It leads to the expression of IFN-gamma receptor on the cell surface with no signal transduction and therefore patients only show a partial response to IFN-gamma. Transmission is autosomal dominant.
725432008,"A genetic variant of mendelian susceptibility to mycobacterial diseases (MSMD) with characteristics of a partial deficiency in IFN-gammaR2, leading to a residual response to IFN-gamma and consequently to recurrent, moderately severe infections with bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) and other environmental mycobacteria. Only one patient has been reported with this variant to date. Caused by a homozygous mutation (R114C) in IFNGR2 on chromosome 21q22.1-22.2 that encodes the IFN-gamma receptor ligand binding chain. This mutation leads to a residual cellular response to IFN-gamma in terms of IL12p40 production. Transmission is autosomal recessive."

725461009,"Disease with characteristics of intrauterine and postnatal growth retardation, microcephaly, facial dysmorphism, skeletal dysplasia, low-birth weight and brain anomalies. Although microcephalic osteodysplastic primordial dwarfism (MOPD) types 1 and 3 were originally described as two separate entities on the basis of radiological criteria (notably small differences in pelvic and long bone structure), later reports confirmed that the two forms represent different modes of expression of the same syndrome. Although the causative gene remains unknown, homozygosity mapping has allowed identification of a candidate gene region on chromosome 2q (2q14.2-q14.3). Histological studies suggest that MOPD types 1 and 3 result from a basic defect in cell proliferation and tissue differentiation. Transmitted as autosomal recessive trait."
725462002,"A type of central congenital hypothyroidism with characteristics of low levels of thyroid hormones due to insufficient release of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) caused by pituitary resistance to thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH). It may or may not be observed from birth. The clinical manifestations are often subtle, probably as a result of trans-placental passage of some maternal thyroid hormone or due to the fact that many infants have some thyroid production of their own. More specific symptoms and signs often do not develop until several months of age. Common clinical features and signs include decreased activity and increased sleep, feeding difficulty and constipation, prolonged jaundice. Slow linear growth and developmental delay are usually apparent by 4-6 months of age. Caused by mutations in the TRH receptor gene (TRHR; 8q23)."

725033008,"A form of familial primary hypomagnesemia characterized by recurrent urinary tract infections, nephrolithiasis, bilateral nephrocalcinosis, renal magnesium wasting, hypercalciuria and kidney failure. This disease is characterized by impaired tubular reabsorption of magnesium and calcium in the thick ascending limb of Henle's loop due to mutations in CLDN16 (3q27), which encodes claudin-16 (previously known as paracellin 1). A significant residual function is observed in several missense mutations, whereas a complete loss of claudin-16 function appears to be more severe with disease presenting earlier and often progressing to kidney failure at a significantly younger age. Transmission is autosomal recessive."

726018006,"Autosomal dominant medullary cystic kidney disease is a chronic tubulointerstitial nephropathy, which belongs to a heterogeneous group of inherited tubulo-interstitial nephritis. Less than 60 families affected have been described. Clinical onset and course are insidious. Symptoms typically appear at an average age of 28 years, when the urinary concentrating ability is markedly reduced, producing polyuria and stable low urinary osmolality in the first morning urine and lack of any compensatory effect after endonasal desmopressin. End-stage renal disease typically occurs in the third-fifth decade of life or even later. Two genes have been linked to the disease: MCKD1 (1q21) and MCKD2 (in 16p12, where the gene UMOD, encoding uromodulin or Tamm-Horsfall protein, has been identified as responsible of the disease)."
726019003,"A rare inherited form of cutaneous melanoma with characteristics of development of histologically confirmed melanoma in two first degrees relatives or more relatives in an affected family. It is thought to account for about 10% of all cases of cutaneous melanoma. Tends to occur earlier than non-familial melanoma. The risk of familial melanoma is closely related to a wide range of genetic alterations in susceptibility genes but also appears to be influenced by phenotypic risk factors, such as pigmentation, freckling and sun reactions. Complex interactions between genetic and environmental factors are therefore thought to underlie the disease. The most common high-penetrance susceptibility gene implicated is CDKN2A, accounting for predisposition in approximately 20% of cases. In some affected families, susceptibility is consistent with autosomal dominant inheritance but in most cases, a polygenic mode of inheritance appears likely."
726021008,"A mitochondrial disorder of long chain fatty acid oxidation characterized in most patients by onset in infancy or early childhood with hypoketotic hypoglycemia, metabolic acidosis, liver disease, hypotonia and frequently cardiac involvement with arrhythmias and/or cardiomyopathy. Caused by the isolated deficiency of long chain 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase, an enzyme of the mitochondrial trifunctional protein complex (TFP). TFP is a heterooctamer of 4 alpha and 4 beta subunits. The disease is due to mutations in the HADHA gene (2p23) that encodes for the alpha subunit of TFP. Mitochondrial trifunctional protein deficiency is clinically indistinguishable from this disease."

726029005,"A rare syndrome that is classically defined by the clinical triad of fibrous dysplasia of bone, cafe-au-lait skin spots and precocious puberty. The disease can involve single or multiple skeletal sites and presents with a limp and/or pain and occasionally, a pathologic fracture. Scoliosis is common and may be progressive. The disease results from somatic mutations of the GNAS gene, specifically mutations in the cAMP-regulating protein, Gs alpha. The extent of the disease is determined by the proliferation, migration and survival of the cell in which the mutation spontaneously occurs during embryonic development. The disease is rarely associated with malignancy however malignant transformation of fibrous dysplasia lesions occurs in probably less than 1% patients."

725295005,"A very rare gonadotropin-independent familial form of male-limited precocious puberty generally presenting between 2-5 years of age as accelerated growth, early development of secondary sexual characteristics and reduced adult height. Caused by an activating mutation of the Lutropin-Choriogonadotropic Hormone Receptor gene (LHCGR, 2p21) which leads to increased levels of sex steroids in the context of low luteinizing hormone. This receptor's chronic activation leads to precocious testosterone production by Leydig cells. No effect is observed in female carriers due to the dual luteinizing hormone (LH)/ follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) signal necessary to promote ovarian stimulation. Transmission is autosomal dominant. Mothers may act as silent carriers, with each son having a 50% chance of displaying this disorder."

733489002,"A neuromuscular disease with characteristics of progressive symmetric muscle weakness of anterior upper and posterior lower limbs. It has been described in several members of an Australian and an Italian family. The disease usually manifests during the third decade of life with thenar muscle weakness resulting in reduced grip strength. The disease is slowly progressive and generally proceeds with calf muscle weakness appearing during the fourth decade and proximal muscles becoming perceptibly affected in the fifth decade. The disease is due to mutations on the actin-binding domain of the FLNC gene that encodes filamin C, a muscle specific filamin that is also associated with myofibrillar myopathy when mutations affect other parts of the protein. The disease mechanism seems to be linked to an increased actin-binding affinity of filamin C."

733491005,"Carney complex (CNC) has characteristics of spotty skin pigmentation, endocrine overactivity and myxomas. The prevalence is unknown but it is a rare disease. Skin pigmentation anomalies include lentigines and blue nevi. The most common endocrine gland manifestations are acromegaly, thyroid and testicular neoplasms and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-independent Cushing's syndrome. Myxomas can be observed in the heart, skin and breast. Cardiac myxomas can develop in any cardiac chamber and may be multiple. One of the putative CNC genes located on 17q22-24, (PRKAR1A), has been found to encode the regulatory subunit (R1A) of protein kinase A. Heterozygous inactivating mutations of PRKAR1A were reported initially in 45 to 65% of CNC index cases, and may be present in about 80% of the CNC families presenting mainly with Cushing's syndrome.

The disease has a variable clinical phenotype that ranges from mild to severe. The broad spectrum of clinical phenotypes that the syndrome encompasses was previously divided into distinct syndromes (for example DiGeorge syndrome, velocardiofacial syndrome, cardiofacial syndrome) but are now known to be identical and are referred to as 22q11.2 deletion sydrome. In most cases, the syndrome is due to a 3 million base pair (Mb) deletion on the chromosomal region 22q11.2 that is flanked by low copy number repeats. The deletion is due to a non-allelic meiotic recombination during spermatogenesis or oogenesis. The variable expression of the 22q11.2 phenotype is thought to be due to genetic modifiers on either the other 22q11.2 allele or on other chromosomes. The deletion arises de novo in 90% of the cases."

The episodes can last for several days and occur weeks to months apart, manifestations include erythematous plaques on the skin, abdominal pain, dry eyes, dry mouth, mouth sores, chest pain and gland enlargement. This condition likely results from a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Variations in the NOD2 gene increase risk and it is suspected that environmental factors such as infections may also play a role in triggering the disease in people with genetic variants that increase their risk. The syndrome appears to be a complex disease without a single genetic cause."

The most common autoimmune endocrine involvement is hypoparathyroidism (79-96% of cases). Adrenal failure most often manifests with concurrent mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid deficiency (78% of cases). The disease is caused by mutations of the AIRE gene (21q22.3) coding for the AIRE transcription factor, which is involved in immune tolerance mechanisms and contributes to the negative selection of autoreactive T lymphocytes in the thymus, lymph nodes and spleen. Transmission is autosomal recessive."

This is a lysosomal storage disease caused by a mutation in the GBA gene (1q21) that codes for the lysosomal enzyme, glucocerebrosidase. The deficiency in glucocerebrosidase leads to the accumulation of glucosylceramidase (or beta-glucocerebrosidase) deposits in the cells of the reticuloendothelial system of the liver, of the spleen and the bone marrow (Gaucher cells).

1230096008,"A rare multiple congenital anomalies syndrome with cardiac involvement as a major feature with characteristics of QT prolongation, congenital heart defects, syndactyly, facial dysmorphism and neurodevelopmental features. There are three clinical phenotypes; the classical types that present with a prolonged QT interval and either with (Timothy syndrome 1) or without (Timothy syndrome 2) cutaneous syndactyly of fingers and toes. The atypical form (ATS) causes multi-system health concerns but not necessarily with prolonged QT. The disease is due to mutations in the CACNA1C gene (12p13.33). The clinical phenotypes correlate with genotype. Most cases arise de novo however in some cases the disease has been identified as an inherited autosomal dominant trait resulting from parental germline mosaicism."

764453009,"Syndrome with characteristics of episodes of myoclonus. Renal disease is an inconsistent feature occurring in some but not all cases. Myoclonic jerks typically occur in the torso, upper and lower limbs and face. Some affected individuals develop seizures, peripheral neuropathy or sensorineural hearing loss. Where renal problems occur, an early sign is proteinuria. Age of onset and the clinical course may vary even among members of the same family. The syndrome is caused by mutations in the SCARB2 gene leading to production of an altered LIMP-2 protein that cannot get to the lysosome. As a result, the movement of beta-glucocerebrosidase to lysosomes is impaired. Inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern."
1231284001,"A rare dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (DEB) characterised by generalised blistering, milia formation, atrophic scarring, and dystrophic nails.

302822000,"A form of functioning pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor characterized most commonly by a solitary, small pancreatic lesion that causes hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia. Insulinoma can present at any age but the median age of diagnosis is in the fifth decade of life. Insulinoma is malignant in only 7-10% of cases and the most common sites of metastasis are the liver and lymph nodes. The etiology is unknown in most sporadic cases but somatic YY1 (14q32.2) variants are associated with insulinoma in some cases. Insulinoma originates in the islet beta cells that are equally distributed throughout the pancreas. When functioning, the tumor manifests with hypersecretion of insulin and consequently causes hypoglycemia. With the exception of insulinoma in MEN1, insulinoma is not hereditary."

Age of onset is variable but most patients are diagnosed during adulthood. Two familial forms of LCAT deficiency have been reported: familial LCAT deficiency characterised by corneal opacities, anaemia and renal insufficiency and Fish-eye disease characterised by corneal opacities and sometimes atherosclerosis. LCAT deficiency is caused by deficient or absent catalytic activity of the LCAT enzyme, which catalyses the formation of cholesterol esters in lipoproteins and is encoded by the LCAT gene (16q22.1). Accumulation of unesterified cholesterol in the body for example in the cornea, erythrocytes and kidneys, is thought to underlie the clinical manifestations."

These lesions are generally more severe than in complete LCAT deficiency and form a mosaic pattern of small dot-like grey-white opacities. Signs of atherosclerosis have only been reported in rare cases although patients have low HDL cholesterol levels. In patients with this disorder, alpha-LCAT activity is abolished, but beta-LCAT activity is preserved. Impaired enzyme function is thought to result in deposition of lipids in the cornea. The disease follows an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance."

The disease usually begins in the first year of life and rarely after 5 years of age. HIDS is an inherited syndrome caused by mutations in the mevalonate kinase (MVK) gene (12q24). These MVK mutations lead to reduced, but not abolished enzyme activity. This in turn leads to impaired control of the production of inflammatory mediators, which in turn cause inflammatory (fever) attacks. The disease follows an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance."
